# Lukas_CLI

This is a small CLI I made to create a react component with an index file.

Current set of commands

```
Commands:
    comp-me <Component-name>     -Creates Folder with component name and index.js file and component.js file                                    (includes pre made component)
```

New additions will be made ove time
